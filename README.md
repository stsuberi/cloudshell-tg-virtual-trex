# Overview
A shell integrates a device model, application or other technology with CloudShell. A shell consists of a data model that defines how the device and its properties are modeled in CloudShell, along with automation that enables interaction with the device via CloudShell.

**Note:** We recommend using a 2nd gen shell where possible. Using a 1st gen shell may limit some shell management capabilities. For more information, see [Shell Overview – “Our Shell”](http://help.quali.com/Online%20Help/8.3/Portal/Content/CSP/LAB-MNG/Shells.htm?Highlight=shell%20overview). 

### Traffic Generator Shells
CloudShell's traffic generator shells enable you to conduct traffic test activities on Devices Under Test (DUT) or Systems Under Test (SUT) from a sandbox. In CloudShell, a traffic generator is typically modeled using a chassis resource, which represents the traffic generator device and ports, and a controller service that runs the chassis commands, such as Load Configuration File, Start Traffic and Get Statistics. Chassis and controllers are modeled by different shells, allowing you to accurately model your real-life architecture. For example, scenarios where the chassis and controller are located on different machines.

For additional information on traffic generator shell architecture, and setting up and using a traffic generator in CloudShell, see the [Traffic Generators Overiew](http://help.quali.com/Online%20Help/9.0/Portal/Content/CSP/LAB-MNG/Trffc-Gens.htm?Highlight=traffic%20generator%20overview) online help topic.

### **Cisco TRex Shells**

To model a **Cisco TRex** device in CloudShell, use one of the following options for either a standard or virtual configuration:

**Standard Option**

▪ [Cisco TRex Chassis 2 Gen Shell](https://community.quali.com/repos/3412/cloudshell-trex-chassis-2-gen-shell), which provides data model and autoload functionality to model and load the Cisco TRex Chassis to resource management.

▪ [Cisco TRex Controller 1G Shell (service)](https://community.quali.com/repos/3410/cloudshell-trex-controller-shell), which provides functionality to load test configuration, run tests, get test results, etc.

**Virtual Option**

▪ [CloudShell TRex Virtual Traffic Generator 1G Shell](https://community.quali.com/repos/3409/cloudshell-trex-virtual-traffic-generator-shell), which creates a CloudShell TRex virtual traffic generator shell. Using this shell, you can create an App that, once deployed in a sandbox, will spin up a VM that models a Cisco TRex traffic generator. 

• [Cisco TRex Controller 1G Shell (service)](https://community.quali.com/repos/3410/cloudshell-trex-controller-shell), which provides functionality to load test configuration, run tests, get tests results, etc.

For more information on the **Cisco TRex** traffic generators, see the official **Cisco TRex** product documentation.

### Offline installation of a shell

**Note:** Offline installation instructions are relevant only if CloudShell Execution Server has no access to PyPi. You can skip this section if your execution server has access to PyPi. For additional information, see the online help topic on offline dependencies.

In offline mode, import the shell into CloudShell and place any dependencies in the appropriate dependencies folder. The dependencies folder may differ, depending on the CloudShell version you are using:

* For CloudShell version 8.3 and above, see [Adding Shell and script packages to the local PyPi Server repository](#adding-shell-and-script-packages-to-the-local-pypi-server-repository).

* For CloudShell version 8.2, perform the appropriate procedure: [Adding Shell and script packages to the local PyPi Server repository](#adding-shell-and-script-packages-to-the-local-pypi-server-repository) or [Setting the python pythonOfflineRepositoryPath configuration key](#setting-the-python-pythonofflinerepositorypath-configuration-key).

### Adding shell and script packages to the local PyPi Server repository
If your Quali Server and/or execution servers work offline, you will need to copy all required Python packages, including the out-of-the-box ones, to the PyPi Server's repository on the Quali Server computer (by default *C:\Program Files (x86)\QualiSystems\CloudShell\Server\Config\Pypi Server Repository*).

For more information, see [Configuring CloudShell to Execute Python Commands in Offline Mode](http://help.quali.com/Online%20Help/9.0/Portal/Content/Admn/Cnfgr-Pyth-Env-Wrk-Offln.htm?Highlight=Configuring%20CloudShell%20to%20Execute%20Python%20Commands%20in%20Offline%20Mode).

**To add Python packages to the local PyPi Server repository:**
  1. If you haven't created and configured the local PyPi Server repository to work with the execution server, perform the steps in [Add Python packages to the local PyPi Server repository (offline mode)](http://help.quali.com/Online%20Help/9.0/Portal/Content/Admn/Cnfgr-Pyth-Env-Wrk-Offln.htm?Highlight=offline%20dependencies#Add). 
  
  2. For each shell or script you add into CloudShell, do one of the following (from an online computer):
      * Connect to the Internet and download each dependency specified in the *requirements.txt* file with the following command: 
`pip download -r requirements.txt`. 
     The shell or script's requirements are downloaded as zip files.

      * In the [Quali Community's Integrations](https://community.quali.com/integrations) page, locate the shell and click the shell's **Download** link. In the page that is displayed, from the Downloads area, extract the dependencies package zip file.

3. Place these zip files in the local PyPi Server repository.
 
### Setting the python PythonOfflineRepositoryPath configuration key
Before PyPi Server was introduced as CloudShell’s python package management mechanism, the `PythonOfflineRepositoryPath` key was used to set the default offline package repository on the Quali Server machine, and could be used on specific Execution Server machines to set a different folder. 

**To set the offline python repository:**
1. Download the relevant *offline_dependencies.zip* file, see [Downloading the Shell](#downloading-the-shell):

	• virtual-trex-offline-packages-1.0.0.zip
	
	• trex_controller-offline-dependencies-1.0.0.zip
	
	• trex_chassis_2g_offline_dependencies-1.0.0.zip
	
	• cloudshell-tg-trex-1.0.0.zip

2. Unzip it to a local repository. Make sure the execution server has access to this folder. 

3.  On the Quali Server machine, in the *~\CloudShell\Server\customer.config* file, add the following key to specify the path to the default python package folder (for all Execution Servers):  
	`<add key="PythonOfflineRepositoryPath" value="repository 
full path"/>`

4. If you want to override the default folder for a specific Execution Server, on the Execution Server machine, in the *~TestShell\Execution Server\customer.config* file, add the following key:  
	`<add key="PythonOfflineRepositoryPath" value="repository 
full path"/>`

5. Restart the Execution Server.

### Configuring a new resource
This section explains how to create a new resource from the CloudShell TRex Chassis 2G shell.

In CloudShell, the component that models the device is called a resource. It is based on the shell that models the device and allows the CloudShell user and API to remotely control the device from CloudShell.

You can also modify existing resources, see [Managing Resources in the Inventory](http://help.quali.com/Online%20Help/9.0/Portal/Content/CSP/INVN/Mng-Rsrc-in-Invnt.htm?Highlight=managing%20resources).

**To create a resource for the device:**
  1. In the CloudShell Portal, in the **Inventory** dashboard, click **Add New**. 
     ![](https://github.com/QualiSystems/cloudshell-shells-documentaion-templates/blob/master/create_a_resource_device.png)
     
  2. From the list, select **Cisco TRex Chassis**.
  
  3. Enter the **Name** and **IP address** of the **Cisco TRex Chassis**.
  
  4. Click **Create**.
  
  5. In the **Resource** dialog box, enter the device's settings. For details, see [Device Name Attributes](#device-name-attributes). 
  
  6. Click **Continue**. <br><br>CloudShell validates the device’s settings and updates the new resource with the device’s structure.
  
### Configuring the setup script
This section explains how to modify the setup script to work with the **CloudShell TRex Virtual Traffic Generator** shell.

**To modify the setup script:**
1. Log in to CloudShell Portal as administrator of the relevant domain.

2. Go to the **Manage** dashboard and click **Scripts>Blueprint**.

3. Download the current setup script.

4. Browse to the location of the downloaded file. 

5. Add *cloudshell-orch-trex>=1.0.0,<1.1.0* into the *requirements.txt* file.

6. Add the following code in the *_main_.py* file:

	`from cloudshell.workflow.orchestration.setup.trex.configuration_commands import configure_virtual_chassis, execute_autoload_on_trexsandbox.workflow.add_to_configuration(function=configure_virtual_chassis, components=sandbox.components.apps)
sandbox.workflow.on_configuration_ended(function=execute_autoload_on_trex, components=sandbox.components.apps))`

7. Update the setup script in CloudShell.

# Updating Python Dependencies for Shells
This section explains how to update your Python dependencies folder. This is required when you upgrade a shell that uses new/updated dependencies. It applies to both online and offline dependencies.

### Updating offline Python dependencies
**To update offline Python dependencies:**
1. Download the latest Python dependencies package zip file locally.

2. Extract the zip file to the suitable offline package folder(s). 

3. Terminate the shell’s instance, as explained [here](http://help.quali.com/Online%20Help/9.0/Portal/Content/CSP/MNG/Mng-Exctn-Srv-Exct.htm#Terminat).

### Updating online Python dependencies
In online mode, the execution server automatically downloads and extracts the appropriate dependencies file to the online Python dependencies repository every time a new instance of the driver or script is created.

**To update online Python dependencies:**
* If there is a live instance of the shell's driver or script, terminate the shell’s instance, as explained [here](http://help.quali.com/Online%20Help/9.0/Portal/Content/CSP/MNG/Mng-Exctn-Srv-Exct.htm#Terminat). If an instance does not exist, the execution server will download the Python dependencies the next time a command of the driver or script runs.
